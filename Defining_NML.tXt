C) Discuss collaboration with neuroscientists and linguists to further develop NLE?
[3/12, 2:47 PM] BrainWave: **REPOSITORY ACCESS GRANTED – LET'S INITIATE NLE LANGUAGE OVERVIEW!**

Before diving into coding and brain mapping:

**NLE Language Overview Document Started:**

**NeuroLingua Evolutia (NLE) Language Specification v0.1**

I'll outline the initial sections – you add/correct as we proceed:
